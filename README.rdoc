* Instructions - You will need to fire the following curl request: 

	curl --basic --header "Content-Type:application/json" --header "Accept:application/json" http://fierce-tundra-8140.herokuapp.com/api/v1/email/ -X POST -d '{ "email": { "to": "shivpkumar@gmail.com", "subject": "hello world", "body": "Hi Shiv! Sending you an email via this awesome API I just made on the interwebs."}, "token": "token_key" }'

This API is authenticated and would work only with the specified token_key. You need to contact the admin for token_key. However you may play with other attributes.
